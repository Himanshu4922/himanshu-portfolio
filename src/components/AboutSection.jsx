          <h2>‚ö° About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of tech wasn‚Äôt a straight path. While I
            didn‚Äôt always know I would end up here, discovering the world of web
            development sparked something in me that‚Äôs kept me hooked ever
            since.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As I delved deeper into web technologies, I found myself captivated
            by how design and functionality come together to create meaningful
            user experiences. Now, I focus on building clean, intuitive, and
            responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with a
            constant curiosity to learn and explore new tools and techniques to
            enhance my skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When I‚Äôm not coding, you can find me writing some posts, catching up
            on a good series, or playing a quick game of cricket üèè
