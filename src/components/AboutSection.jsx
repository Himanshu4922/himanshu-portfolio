          <p>
            Hey! I‚Äôm Himanshu Bisht ‚Äî to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt always into coding.
            But once I got introduced to JavaScript and started exploring how
            websites and user interfaces actually work behind the scenes,
            something just clicked.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The more I learned about the logic, structure, and the little
            details that make websites interactive, the more fascinated I
            became. Now, I love building smooth, responsive experiences using
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I‚Äôm always exploring new tools
            to sharpen my skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, watching a
            good series, or heading out for a quick game of cricket.üèè
